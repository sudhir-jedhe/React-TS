Scrollspy is a navigation which shows the menu items as active if their corresponding section are in view area.

There are two parts of scrollspy component.

You can see in the image that as we scroll and when the sections are visible their respective menu link is becoming active.
When clicked on these links we should also scroll to their corresponding section.
I am sure that now you have a got a good idea about what are we going to build, So lets start creating it.

But let me tell you this is a little complex component because we have to handle many different things.

To make our development little easy we are going to utilize few extra external packages.

prop-types: To validate the props.
classnames: This helps to use CSS classes as javascript objects, we just need to name our CSS file as filename.module.css.


menus contains the names of the menu items using which we generate the navbar inside our component.

sections contains all the elements which will are linked to the each menu items. It is ultra necessary to maintain the order otherwise the component wonâ€™t work properly.

We will not validate the items strength in both arrays as we expect the parent component to pass the proper data.

scrollSpeed determines the speed at which the window is scrolled to the section when menu items are clicked in the nav.

We are not using an external library instead we will be creating our own custom function for smooth scrolling.
