Implement a component <Game /> that will receive an object data as a prop. Each key of the object would be a country and corresponding value would be its capital.
const DATA = {
    'India': 'Delhi',
    'Russia': 'Moscow',
    'China': 'Berlin',
     ...
}
Render the list of countries and capitals in the random order on the UI.
The aim of the game is to select the country and its capitals.
The user can select 2 options. The default border color of an option should be #414141.
Selected option should have blue color border.
If the user selection is correct the selected options border color should change to #66cc99 and both options should disappear from the screen after 1000 ms.
If the user selection is incorrect then the selected options border color should change to red and reset after 1000 ms.
When there are no options left on the screen then show a message Congratulations.
