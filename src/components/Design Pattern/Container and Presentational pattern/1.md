Keeping the application logic isolated in one place is really crucial, as this provides us with a single source of truth that can be referred to for any changes.

Using the container/presentational paradigm in React is one strategy to ensure the separation of concerns. We may distinguish between the application logic and the view by employing this pattern.

This pattern is an alternative to the higher-order component pattern in React.

Containers are components that isolate the application logic, restricting their concerns about what data has to be shown. while presentation components focus on how the data has to be shown.








The contianer/presentational pattern in React is most suited for the class-based component where we cannot use the hooks.

The hook/view pattern is for the functional components in React.

Both are similar, as their focus is on separating the logics.

By separating the concerns, it makes the component more readable and developer-friendly. For example, as presentational components are pure components that do not mutate the application logic, they can be easily extended by developers. They donâ€™t have to worry about the logic implications in case they change anything, as its sole purpose is to view things.
